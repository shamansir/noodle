* [v]: Pretty-print Hydra structure;
* [v]: Dockerfile, fix deployment;
* `Out` with a buffer number;
* `to-buffer` and `from-buffer` nodes;
* Ribbons;
* [v]: Don't show hidden inlets;
* [v]: Color node with preview;
* [v]: Palette node;
* Node for sequences — accepting values so that sequences could be joined;
* Math node;
* Pi node;
* Preview node (to see the contents of the output);
* The nodes with some status display inside (i.e. `osc`);
* The node with interactive control inside (i.e. knob in Num node);
* Spreads node, min/max/step;
* Be able to compile expressions;
* Nodes to help with expressions;
* Caluclate the number of links for slots and support styling the "empty" ones differently;
* Different link styles;
* Different connector styles;
* Value editors;
* Preview sequences;
* Finish remove-node buttons;
* Be able to dim slot if it's not connected to anything;
* Use CSS styles constructor;
* Find a way to make `Node`s a `Functor`, to be able to map data;
* Better layouting, may be using `Flex` layout;
* Hover areas are still not perfect;
* Some nodes are harder to drag after adding them;
* Why sometimes Hydra output is not working;
* Blinking when user starts to drag the node;
* Hot/cold inlets;
* Node Families and Channel IDs could be parameters of toolkit etc.;
* Layouts are just positions bounds to components, unify searching by position, adding items etc. to them;
* Some universal layouting like `elm-ui`, but for `purs`;
* `NoodleM`, which has `patch_state` as state and also provides access to inlets and outlets — so what can be used in `effectful` processing function of the node;
