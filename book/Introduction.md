# Introduction

Noodle provides Web API for developing Visual Programming Tools. 

The code could be written both in `PureScript`or in `JavaScript`. There is also a quick plain text format called `NDF`(Noodle Node Definitions) for describing and generating toolkits easily. It could be hosted serverless and with server where data could be transferred using `WebSocket` technology. The out-of-the-box UI renderers are:

* _Terminal User Interface_ using node.js and chjj blessed library;
* _Web interface_ (in works), using PureScriptâ€™s Halogen;
* _Virtual Reality interface_ (planned) using A-Frame;

Also we provide some demos of the possibilities using, for example, Hydra artwork generator.
